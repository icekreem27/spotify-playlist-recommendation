-Scraping the user’s top songs to base the recommender on using Spotify’s API

-Exploring user streaming history to understand music preferences

-Developing a classification algorithm with 99.5% accuracy to use to recommend songs

-Saving recommended songs from the algorithm to a Spotify playlist within the user’s account
